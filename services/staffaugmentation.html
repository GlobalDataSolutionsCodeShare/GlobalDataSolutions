               <h3>Technology Staffing Services</h3>
              </div>

              <div class="legal_txt">

We begin our process by studying your business goals and the discrepancies between your current and future goals. We then process the resources in strategic areas to bridge the gaps in your business.</p>
               <h3>Complete Workforce Solutions:</h3>
               <p>Your success is our motto. Your success lies in achieving your target - in time and within budget. We have acquired the reputation of process driven IT staffing provider. We arrange an array of workforce solutions and service delivery models to equip you with the people, skills and competencies required to excel IT.</p>
               <h3>Contract Staffing</h3>
               <p>High-caliber teams or individual IT professionals for temporary support Contract professionals boost flexibility and productivity. Nearly three million contract professionals go to work at U.S. firms every day.
Contract staffing goes by many names — staff augmentation, temporary staffing, contingent labor, consulting. Whatever term you use, it's a recognized and sensible strategy to support your short-term needs and long-term growth. Contract staffing is one of the GDS's key services.</p>
               <p>If you are looking to expand staffing levels with minimal risk, GDS can provide the highly skilled, mid- to senior-level contract professionals you need. Advantages include: Thorough screening and assessment according to exact specifications</p>
           
           
            <ul>
            <li>Assurance of sourcing highly qualified personnel, even in tight labor markets</li>
            <li>Immediate response from dedicated and specialized recruiting sector.</li>
            <li>Constantly expanding the talent pool so we're ready when you call</li>
            <li>Consultants who are valued as an integral part of our team, and therefore yours</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><b>Benefits of Using Contract Staffing</b></h4>
            <p>Flexibility is just the beginning. In an American Staffing Association poll, 90% of respondents agreed that 'Staffing companies offer flexibility to businesses so that they can keep fully staffed during busy times.' Staffing challenges can arise for number reasons and a few to mention are - business growth, demand cycles, technology implementations and mergers and acquisitions.</p>
            <p>Skilled contract professionals provide extra support and infuse critical knowledge to your organization. Taking advantage for critical business functions and operations support also leaves more time for leadership to focus on strategic initiatives. Furthermore, you can:</p>

           
           
            <ul>
            <li>Manage project overflow, peak periods and special assignments</li>
            <li>Increase responsiveness to your external and internal customers</li>
            <li>Outsource the burden of recruiting, hiring and paying contingent workers</li>
            <li>Keep your permanent staff focused on more challenging, interesting and substantive work</li>
            <li>Reduce employee “burn-out” by supplementing your core staff with contract employees</li>
            <li>Take advantage of flexible pricing options to save money; and</li>
            <li>Manage your department or unit more efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><b>Route to proven full-time employees</b></h4>
            <p>Besides flexibility, businesses also look to staffing firms as a good source of talent for permanent employees. Referred to as contract-to-hire (or temp-to-perm), you may wish to convert successful consultants to a full-time career with your organization. That gives both parties a chance to ‘test the waters,' and it's fine with us.</p>
            <h3>Direct Placements: Contract-to-hire and direct hires for longer-term needs</h3>
            <h4>Direct Placement Services:</h4>
            <p>We help you identify talented, highly experienced IT professionals who are an ideal match with your organization's culture. Though we often focus on contract positions, which give you the opportunity to gauge the IT professional on a temporary basis with no commitment from you, when you need to fill a direct hire position, we streamline the entire process for you.</p>
            <p>We Market Your Value Proposition</p>
            <p>GDS's Talent Acquisition Analysts' understand today's extremely competitive IT job market and the challenges you face when searching for top IT talent.
